PLACEHOLDER - Replace this file with actual QR code

Since I cannot generate images directly, please:

1. Create a QR code (200x200px minimum) pointing to your review/social media page
2. Save it as "download.png" in the /public/ folder
3. Delete this placeholder file

Temporary solution:
- The app will display an error if this file doesn't exist as download.png
- You can use https://www.qr-code-generator.com/ to create your QR code
- Compress the image to <100KB for fast loading

Example QR code destinations:
- Google Reviews link
- Instagram profile
- Facebook page
- WhatsApp business number
